<h1>BizOps Configurator Overview</h1>
<h3>What the heck is this thing?</h3>
<p>This is a Single Page App (SPA) to get inputs from the user and from the Dynatrace API, to transform a stock collection of currated dashboards, and to upload via the Dynatrace API</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>There's amazing insights that be unlocked just by using stock Dynatrace dashboard tiles. Building dashboards is pretty easy: just drag and drop, populate a few USQL queries, and poof business relevant insights. How can we make it even faster? Share a currated list of dashboards used across our customer base and customize queries with a few clicks and drags. All using the power of the Dynatrace API that's already available.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>We organized dasbhoard packs based on two dimensions:</p>
<p><i>Persona</i> How is the audience for the dashboards? For example, an Application Overview might look different for a Developer vs Line of Business vs IT Exec.</p>
<p><i>Usecase</i> What's the purpose of the dashboards?</p>

<h3>BizOps Dashboard IDs</h3>
Wait... these dashboard IDs don't look as random as normal Dynatrace dashboard IDs. What's going on here? For BizOps Dashboards we predefine the dashboard ID to make it easier to track the dashboards as a collection. Couldn't that conflict with a dashboards we create the normal way? Yes! but it's only a 1 in 1.2e^24th chance.<br>
Example: </p>
<span class="id-1">bbbbbbbb</span>-<span class="id-2">0001</span>-<span class="id-3">0001</span>-<span class="id-4">0001</span>-<span class="id-5">0000000000001</span>
<ul class="ids">
  <li><span class="id-1">bbbbbbbb</span> - Prefix to denote BizOpsConfigurator Dashboards</li>
  <li><span class="id-2">a001</span> - Persona</li>
  <li><span class="id-3">a001</span> - Usecase</li>
  <li><span class="id-4">0001</span> - Dashboard number, 0000 for overview ffff for config</li>
  <li><span class="id-5">0000000000001</span> - Deployment number</li>
</ul>

<h3>GitOps</h3>
<p>We're using a GitOps approach to maintaining these dashboards. Owners of the dashboards have their own public repos with the JSONs. The configurator just pulls from those repos, transmogrifies, and uploads to your tenant.</p>

<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p><b>I've got some awesome dashboards everyone would find useful!</b> - That's great! We'd love to see them. Click on Developer Guide to learn how to turn dashboards into a dashboard pack you can deploy. You can test it by adding your repo to your session by using the Gear menu. When you're ready, please open an <a href="https://github.com/Dynatrace/BizOpsConfigurator/issues" class="newTab" target="_blank">Issue <img src='images/link.svg'></a>Issue on Github when you're ready for your repo to be available for all BizOpsConfigurator users.</p>
<ul>
  <li>a link to your GitHub repo</li>
  <li>an example screenshot</li>
  <li>a text description of any prerequisites outside of BizOpsConfigurator</li>
</ul>
<p> Please note: we may not end up using your dashboard. While it might be great for your team, it may not fit for a wider audience or it may be just too hard to transform automatically.</p>
