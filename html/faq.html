        <li><b>Do I need a Management Zone configured?</b><br>
          No, you can use "All", but MZs are genarlly recommended.</li>
        <li><b>What is a "GitHub PAT"? Why do I need one?</b><br>
            This tool downloads all of the dashboards with an API call to GitHub. Unauthenticated you can do 50 calls per hour... 
            but this is limited by Public IP address. So if you're in a large organization or at an event (eg Perform), 
            then you and everyone else could easily hit this limit. With a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) this limit jumps up to 5000/hr 
            for your user alone. See: <a class='newTab'

            Be sure to add "public_repo" scope to your PAT.<br>

            Certain data points, such as USPs, KUAs, etc are not queriable via the Dynatrace /config endpoint yet. Instead the
            configurator relies on USQL queries to determine which are in your environment. This means that if the USP/KUA/etc 
            wasn't seen in the past 5000 User Sessions, it won't show up in the list. This can be challenging in low traffic 
            environments, but unfortunately there isn't another way to query these. If there's demand for it, we could add
            a manual text box where you could type in the USP etc, but we'd like to avoid the Human Error risk this presents.
            A better alternative is to simply execute a few test transactions against your application to populate the values.</li>
