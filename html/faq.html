        <li><b>Do I need a Management Zone configured?</b><br>
          No, you can use "All", but MZs are genarlly recommended.</li>
        <li><b>What is a "GitHub PAT"? Why do I need one?</b><br>
            This tool downloads all of the dashboards with an API call to GitHub. Unauthenticated you can do 50 calls per hour... 
            but this is limited by Public IP address. So if you're in a large organization or at an event (eg Perform), 
            then you and everyone else could easily hit this limit. With a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) this limit jumps up to 5000/hr 
            for your user alone. See: <a class='newTab'

            Be sure to add "public_repo" scope to your PAT.<br>
